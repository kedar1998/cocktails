## Reflection

In this project, I learned to use API using fetch. I also used react-router-dom for routing different routes. When clicked on single cocktail a detailed view of that cocktial is opened, which I have implemented using react-router-dom.

The technologies implemented in this project are React and TailwindCSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
